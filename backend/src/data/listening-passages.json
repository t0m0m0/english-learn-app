Most everyday decisions are made using System 1, which can lead to cognitive biases and systematic errors in judgment. For example, the anchoring effect causes people to rely too heavily on the first piece of information they receive, while confirmation bias leads individuals to seek out evidence that supports their pre-existing beliefs. Understanding these biases is essential for making better decisions in both personal and professional contexts.",
